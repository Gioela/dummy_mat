1st project in C in last AIV year.

The Scope of this exercise is: understand and test the pointer concept and how
 it can be managed in f(x)'s parameters.

Important: program is made by the only run.c file.
The others files (dummy_mat.c and mat_func.h) at moment aren't included in run.c
(also if they are committed).

When start the exe file, you must specify at least 2 input numbers like parameters.
